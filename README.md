# mlops-recommendation-system
End-to-End Recommendation System (MLOps Proof of Concept)

This project demonstrates a production-style MLOps architecture focused on reliability, graceful degradation, and operational correctness, rather than model experimentation.

The system integrates a frontend application, a backend API layer, and an ML inference service.
A core design goal is ensuring the system always returns a valid, explainable response, even when machine-learning predictions are unavailable or unreliable.

System Architecture

Components

Frontend (Next.js) – user interface that requests recommendations

Backend API (Spring Boot) – system boundary that owns API contracts, validation, and fallback logic

Inference Service (FastAPI) – isolated ML service responsible for loading models and returning predictions

Database (PostgreSQL) – product data and (optionally) user/event data

Key Principle

The backend acts as the reliability boundary: ML is used when available, but never allowed to violate system guarantees.

(Architecture diagram included in this repository.)

Key Behaviors

Cold-start handling: If ML returns empty results, the backend falls back to deterministic popular items

Graceful degradation: If inference errors or times out, the system still returns a valid response

Explainability: Responses include metadata (source, reason) indicating whether ML or fallback was used

Separation of concerns: UI, backend, and inference services are independently deployable

Why This Project Exists

This project was built to explore how ML systems behave in real production environments, including:

sparse data

cold-start users

model uncertainty

downstream service failures

The focus is operational ML, not offline model accuracy.
